# Project Description

This project is for the author to take notes on the training of code programming skills. The programming language is C++. All code questions are from the [leetcode website](https://leetcode.cn/). 

Different folders represent different data structures or algorithms. The title is named by number and name in leetcode. All the notes and ideas are in Chinese. All code formats are function formats that conform to leetcode, not complete program code.

The content is referred to [https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master). 

I have completed the same content again in the [https://github.com/Max-luo-song/leetcode_2022](https://github.com/Max-luo-song/leetcode_2022)

I hope this project can help you!!!
